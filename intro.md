ok now lets understand how the full stack application connects its components each other. for full stack application we have 
1. database or source to store data
2. database communication with backend
3. backend code, preferrebly .net c#
4. types of application, whether if its a mobile, desktop, or web application, or any utility
5. security for these layers
6. how we structure the application in a standard, best way
7. how to scale iw we need and tools for it
8. where to host align with the requirement
9. continuous integration, what this for? is it adding new faetures without breaking the functionality?
10. continuous deployment
11. pipelines
12. environments to run, and types. is Docker can be considered as an environment to run our application or service?
13. frontend, the standard and most suitable frameworks. preffered Angular, can i stick with this for the future as well or do i need to look at another techs 
14.what are the other factors we need to consider for full stack developments

for all the project do we need all of these components? no, but for learning process we can create a project and do create these components.

if we create these architecture diagram f each application type we can get a clear idea what'sthe difference between them.
then we can create projects on top of them.

* understanding architecture and how these components connect each other first.

*another thing is making public your application or service to be accessible anywhere in the world, like azure, aws or google cloud hosting. this is for cloud computing right, we dont pay for the infrastructure, we pay pro their services. we dont have to consider managing the infrastructure. like when we buy a dedicated hosting somewhere from some company, say Register.lk, we use their servers as infrastructre. and then we build upon their hardware, are these hardware situated somewhere in their facility? or are these also from the cloud? and if we take azure for that, azure is like vast spread data centers and with their infrastructure all over the world. so we have a sense that we can rely on them, to secure, for availability for our services. am i correct?*

You're absolutely correct in your understanding! Let me break down the key concepts you've touched on:

## Cloud Computing vs Traditional Hosting

**Cloud Computing (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud):**
- ‚úÖ You're right - you pay for **services**, not infrastructure
- ‚úÖ No need to manage physical servers, networking, or data centers
- ‚úÖ Global infrastructure with data centers worldwide
- ‚úÖ Built-in security, availability, and scalability features
- ‚úÖ Pay-as-you-go or subscription models

**Traditional Dedicated Hosting (like Register.lk):**
- You rent physical servers from their facility
- These are typically **physical servers** in their data center
- You're responsible for more management tasks
- Fixed costs regardless of usage

## Infrastructure Location

You're spot on about the infrastructure:

**Traditional Hosting:**
- Physical servers in the hosting company's data center
- Usually in one or a few locations
- You're tied to that specific physical location

**Cloud Providers (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud):**
- Massive global network of data centers
- Your application can run across multiple regions
- Data replication and backup across continents
- Much higher availability and disaster recovery

## Why Cloud is More Reliable

Your understanding is correct about reliability:

1. **Global Presence**: Data centers worldwide mean better performance and redundancy
2. **Security**: Enterprise-grade security measures and compliance certifications
3. **Availability**: 99.9%+ uptime guarantees with automatic failover
4. **Scalability**: Can handle traffic spikes automatically
5. **Maintenance**: Cloud providers handle all hardware maintenance and updates

## The Key Difference

- **Traditional hosting**: You're essentially renting a specific physical server
- **Cloud computing**: You're using a vast, distributed infrastructure that can dynamically allocate resources as needed

So yes, you're absolutely right that cloud providers like Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud offer much more reliable, secure, and globally accessible infrastructure compared to traditional dedicated hosting. The cloud model has revolutionized how we think about hosting applications!

*okay, so if we choose from one of the cloud providers, what do you suggest, as you know my current familiar tech stack what do you suggest? and please feel free if i need to change something what i am doing, thgis way i can start my career again in a new era with all these clarifications.*
