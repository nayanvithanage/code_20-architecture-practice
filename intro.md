ok now lets understand how the full stack application connects its components each other. for full stack application we have 
1. database or source to store data
2. database communication with backend
3. backend code, preferrebly .net c#
4. types of application, whether if its a mobile, desktop, or web application, or any utility
5. security for these layers
6. how we structure the application in a standard, best way
7. how to scale iw we need and tools for it
8. where to host align with the requirement
9. continuous integration, what this for? is it adding new faetures without breaking the functionality?
10. continuous deployment
11. pipelines
12. environments to run, and types. is Docker can be considered as an environment to run our application or service?
13. frontend, the standard and most suitable frameworks. preffered Angular, can i stick with this for the future as well or do i need to look at another techs 
14.what are the other factors we need to consider for full stack developments

for all the project do we need all of these components? no, but for learning process we can create a project and do create these components.

if we create these architecture diagram f each application type we can get a clear idea what'sthe difference between them.
then we can create projects on top of them.
